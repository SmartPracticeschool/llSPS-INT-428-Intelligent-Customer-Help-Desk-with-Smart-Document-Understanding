# llSPS-INT-428-Intelligent-Customer-Help-Desk-with-Smart-Document-Understanding

This is made with the regard of partial fullfillment of Smartinternz Internship Program.

This is repositroy build Using the Watson Discovery Smart Document Understanding (SDU) feature, we will enhance the Discovery model so that queries will be better focused to only search the most relevant information found in a typical owner's manual and Using Watson Assistant, we will use a standard customer care dialog to handle a typical conversation between a custmomer and a company representitive. When a customer question involves operation of a product, the Assistant dialog will communicate with the Discovery service using a webhook.The webhook will be created by defining a web action using IBM Cloud Functions.

# Project Description

The typical customer care chatbot can answer simple questions, such as store locations and hours, directions, and maybe even making appointments. When a question falls outside of the scope of the pre-determined question set, the option is typically to tell the customer the question isn’t valid or offer to speak to a real person.

To take it a step further, we will use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.
